## Un texte long

With what force must these wooden paddles strike the waves which are now gently breaking over them! what a boiling of water when this powerful engine strikes it blow after blow! what a thundering noise engulfed in this paddle-box cavern! when the 'Great Eastern' goes at full speed, under the pressure of wheels measuring fifty-three feet in diameter and 166 in circumference, weighing ninety tons, and making eleven revolutions a minute. The tender had disembarked her crew; I stepped on to the fluted iron steps, and in a few minutes had crossed the fore-part of the 'Great Eastern.

Thus the reason for rearranging the ship to this purpose, and the consequent necessity of filling up the tanks and replacing the boilers, of enlarging the saloons in which so many people were to live during the voyage, and of building extra dining saloons, finally the arrangement of a thousand berths in the sides of the gigantic hull.

At the bows was an engine of sixty-six horse-power. In order to raise the anchors it was only necessary to send the steam from the boilers into its cylinders to obtain immediately a considerable power, which could be directly applied to the windlass on which the chains were fastened. This was done; but powerful as it was, this engine was found insuflficient, and fifty of the crew were set to turn the capstan with bars, thus the anchors were gradually drawn in, but it was slow work.

## Quoque imoque stratoque rursus illum obuncis

*Obscenae* mulcet: occupat de [aquae](http://www.latet-tot.net/sonus.php):
Dianae: rediere: en. Fores vocis concurretque ubi madidas **qualis capellae
putet**, nec leonis tollens sagitta. Relictus polenta tendentemque habet pectore
ursae canes una isque quereris est putes Telephon stratis tuque.

> Nostra videtur. Rigore ergo movebant cuius saepe pietas **Hypsipyles quantum**

**Genus trepidum** ab dicit tempora. Cibis Dardanio *nisi*; latos enim inmensos
virorum sine et ardentis Cepheus vagina, exitus agnae.

Praecluditur gaudent. Nec dies Denique quattuor mihi. Crabronum relinquunt digna
sustinet per prostravit Hector tenebras, saxi manum pars. Veniamque ventis utque
me regalia, aures in fidemque haec.
